## Deployer

This is an **example** of a microservice which could deploy a smart contract containing a merkle tree.

In reality, you'll replace this microservice with your own application which wishes to use a merkle-tree.

Your application will then call the [merkle-tree microservice](/merkle-tree/README.md) via its API routes.

Hopefully this microservice provides a clear example for how to take an existing application, and leverage the [merkle-tree microservice](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/timber/tree/master/merkle-tree).
